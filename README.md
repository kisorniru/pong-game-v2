# pong-game

“Pong Game” is a classic game. I tried to develope it by python to learn python. I import “turtle” to work on terminal screen. Imported “os” to ensure sound. I personally use LINUX that's why use “os”, For windows use “winsound”, mac user can go with me. I added comments for better understand.
